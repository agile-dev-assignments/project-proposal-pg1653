# Project Proposal

### Project title
Blognote

### What and why?
Writing is a tool for thought. Yet our thoughts are often connected with each other, forming a web of relations between ideas and concepts. New note-taking applications such as [Roam Research](http://roamresearch.com) and [Notion](http://notion.so) take advantage of this with backlinks (linking notes with notes that reference them), but they have extremely complicated functions and features. More importantly, many of us want to share our thoughts with others, yet these tools function as note-taking applications and not tools for blogging — and simple, modern blogs can't represent our thoughts in such a natural, connected manner.

_Blognote_ is a web application where users can easily publish their notes as a blog, with every note connected to other notes that reference them. It is conceptually inspired by independent researcher [Andy Matuschak's working notes](https://notes.andymatuschak.org/), who is researching this very subject — however, he has not released a public prototype of his working notes system. _Blognote_, however, is publicly accessible, where users can create their own blogs with connected notes and share their domain.

With _Blognote_, sharing and creating ideas becomes simple. With references across their blog, users will have the capability to share their writing in a new, more flexible fashion.

### For whom?
This application is for anyone who writes for developing their thoughts and creativity and wants to share them with the world. It's also for anyone who blogs but wants the flexibility of backlinks and references in their posts/notes. And this population of people definitely exists

### How?
Users have to create an account. Once registered and logged in, they can add notes to their blog. These notes will be formatted in Markdown, with specific delimiters to identify links or references to other notes. Users can add, edit and delete notes as well as view writing statistics such as word-count.  

Users can publish their blog either publicly or privately (where they will have to be logged in to view their blog). This blog will have a simple interface, and each note/post will have their backlinks  listed.

### Scope
This project is reasonable for a group of approximately 4 - 6 programmers to undertake in one semester. React.js would be needed for the front-end, especially in generating a smooth, clean interface. Simple animations (like for example, when you click a link) would need to be implemented. Databases as well — to store the notes, the users and statistics. We would also need to add user login/register capability. Most importantly, many more features can be added if the current system is too simple, such as integrations with external applications like Grammarly, popups when hovering over links, a more functional interface, interface themes, automatically suggesting backlinks using natural language processing, and more.
